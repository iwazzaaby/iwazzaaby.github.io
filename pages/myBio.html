    <h1> Imam Wahyono </h1>
    <p> Assalaamualaikum Warahmatullahi Wabarakatuh. My name is Imam Wahyono. I was born and raised in Indonesia till I was 17 years old when I moved to the US. Now I am 35 years old and never been married. Currently I reside in Riverside, approximately 20 minutes away from Islamic Center of Corona-Norco. I've been living there with my cousin's family since 2009 when we purchased a home together.</p>

    <p> Though I have been living here and away from my parents for a long period of time, but Alhamdulillah Allah SWT has blessed me with lots of righteous friends and relatives who have helped me to be true to our deen. I always try to surround me with good companions because they can help me stay in-check and remind me when i do slack off or drifting into the wrong path. I joined a non-profit organization such as IMSA (Indonesia Muslim Society in America) or just being active as a member in Indonesian community halaqah in and around Los Angeles area. Being active in the masajid especially with the youth program and becoming an outdoor activity coordinator such as camping hiking etc.  </p>

    <p>As for education, Alhamdulillah I was able to attend Islamic institution and boarding schools when I was younger (during middle and high school years) in Indonesia. I dont know where I would be without those early Islamic education. When I moved here after I graduated from highschool, I attended Santa Ana College and got my degree in computer science.</p>

    <p> As for criteria for my future wife: I am not gonna say a lot of things in this part as I know that I am far from perfect. I am not what you call a good muslim; I just try to be one. I try to go masjid everyday even only for one prayer in jamaah. i try to read Qur'an and memorize it daily eventhough not much. I try to learn more and more about our deen everyday either by attending lectures in masajid, youtubes, raeding books or attending halaqahs every weeks. So I would like her to have the same inclination toward those things. I would like her to wear hijab of course and keep up with her daily prayers of course. </p>
